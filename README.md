# 2048 Game Clone

This is a Python implementation of the popular 2048 game built using the tkinter library. Enjoy sliding and merging the tiles to reach 2048!

## Features

- 4x4 game grid
- Tile merging and shifting logic
- Score tracking
- Random tile generation (90% chance for a 2, 10% for a 4)
- Game over detection

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-game-clone.git
cd 2048-game-clone
```

### Run the Game

Simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python game2048.py
```

Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as `game2048.py`. If your Python executable is named differently (e.g., `python3`), use that instead:

```bash
python3 game2048.py
```

### Gameplay Instructions

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with the sum of the numbers.
- The game continues until no more moves are possible.
- Aim to create a tile with the number 2048 to win!
